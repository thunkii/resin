Resonance Visualization, or `resin` for short: make pretty plots and charts of Solar System bodies in a mean-motion resonance.
Heavily based on and uses E. Smirnov's `resonances`: https://github.com/smirik/resonances and its REBOUND backend to do the computation.
resin can also take a SOLEX output file and plot that (as long as the output frame is correct).

Some additional output parameters have been added to thunkii/resonances to make resin slightly more practical; use that.

This script is still in an alpha state and a lot of things might not work.
